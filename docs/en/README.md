# Welcome to PRISM

The Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM) is a multi-tier system that fuses satellite precipitation and vegetation data, crowdsourced food price data and household survey data. It provides integrated visualisations of the extent of extreme rainfall, flood and drought affected areas, the impact on food market structure and pricing, and the coping strategies and resilience of affected populations. The system automates data acquisition and processing, ensuring up-to-date information is available to participating organisations and governments.

The tool is the result of a collaboration between practitioners in the field of food security and food assistance and data experts working to harness big data for development and humanitarian action. The platform delivers insights for the improved targeting of public policy, as well as, over time, better risk models for the development of mitigation strategies.

The tool can be used to understand the evolving nature of slow onset but medium impact phenomena like [El Ni単o](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni単o) and [La Ni単a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni単a) in near real-time to better target government and WFP assistance to vulnerable populations.
