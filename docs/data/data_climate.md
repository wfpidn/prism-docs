# Climate

The climate are varies by location and by time of year. Dekad rainfall, daily rainfall forecast and monthly temperature are a few of the many datasets found under our climate section.

## Rainfall

Many research institutions are producing global satellite precipitation estimate, and mostly available for public. Most notably products are CHIRPS, GPM IMERG, and NOAA GEFS. 

### CHIRPS

Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) from Climate Hazard Center (CHC), Department of Geography, University of California Santa Barbara - https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps is a 35+ year quasi-global rainfall data set. Spanning 50°S-50°N (and all longitudes) and ranging from 1981 to near-present, CHIRPS incorporates CHC's in-house climatology, CHPclim, 0.05° resolution satellite imagery, and in-situ station data to create gridded rainfall time series for trend analysis and seasonal drought monitoring.

## Land Surface Temperature

Various satellite data provide land surface temperature as one of the product, Landsat, MODIS Terra Aqua and Sentinel are some of them.

### MODIS

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS/Terra Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity 8-Day L3 Global 1 km Grid SIN V006 (MOD11A2) dataset provides global land surface temperature data (LST). The MOD11A2 version 6 product provides an average, 8-day, per-pixel LST  in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid. Each pixel value in the MOD11A2 is a simple average of all the corresponding MOD11A1 LST pixels collected within that 8 day period. The 8 day compositing period was chosen because twice that period is the exact ground track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. 

| Characteristic  | Description  |
|---|---|
| Function  | Displays 8 or 16-days land surface temperature data  |
| Variable  | Day time temperature  |
| Geographic coverage  | Global |
| Spatial resolution  | 1 km  |
| Temporal resolution  | 8-days  |
| Format  | HDF-EOS  |
| Unit  | Kelvin, with scale factor 0.02.  |
