# Data

PRISM hosts an extensive set of data related to climate, temperature, vegetation, cropland, population, socio-economic and food security. Some data are originally developed by WFP and partner organizations. Other data are available in public domain and developed by governments, NGOs, and/or companies. The data vary in accuracy, resolution, frequency of update, and geographic coverage. Data summary below mainly highlights the format, methods and technicalities (links to the sources provided). Full download of the datasets is available for most sources.

## Data Standards

PRISM is committed to providing highest quality and latest available data on the impact of climate hazards on the most vulnerable communities. All data available have been verified and classified with respect to its quality, timeliness, accuracy, completeness, geographic coverage and objectivity. In some cases, the best available data are still imperfect. In those cases, we will add a notification on the fallacies.

## Open Data Policy

PRISM is committed to provide an open, downloadable and useful data. We believe that open data amplify rapid improvement in innovation, information sharing, analysis and transparency which are important to support [SDG 2](https://www.wfp.org/zero-hunger). For datasets retrieved from other sources, please refer to the original sources accordingly.
