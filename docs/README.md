# PRISM
Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring

## General Overview

WFP's PRISM is a multi-tier system that fuses satellite precipitation and vegetation data, crowdsourced food price data and household survey data. It provides integrated visualisations of the extent of extreme rainfall, flood and drought affected areas, the impact on food market structure and pricing, and the coping strategies and resilience of affected populations. The system automates data acquisition and processing, ensuring up-to-date information is available to participating organisations and governments.

The tool is the result of a collaboration between practitioners in the field of food security and food assistance and data experts working to harness big data for development and humanitarian action. The platform delivers insights for the improved targeting of public policy, as well as, over time, better risk models for the development of mitigation strategies.

The tool can be used to understand the evolving nature of slow onset but medium impact phenomena like [El Niño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Niño) and [La Niña](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Niña) in near real-time to better target government and WFP assistance to vulnerable populations.

## History

**2014**

 - [PRISM](https://insight.wfp.org/prism-using-data-to-save-lives-in-cambodia-9607ebde5e21) born in Cambodia as a tool for visualising program performance in near-real time through mobile data collection tools and web-based mapping tools.

**2015**

 - The [super](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014–16_El_Niño_event) El Niño of 2015-2016 was the biggest, so far, of the 21st century hit South East Asian country hard, caused prolonged drought and impact on agriculture production failure.

**2016**

 - The Vulnerability Analysis and Monitoring Platform for Impact of Regional Events - [VAMPIRE](http://vampire.pulselabjakarta.org/#) (an inside pun which played on WFP’s Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping unit’s acronym) born in Indonesia, developed by [World Food Programme](https://www.wfp.org/countries/indonesia), [Pulse Lab Jakarta](http://pulselabjakarta.id/) and [Food and Agriculture Organization](http://www.fao.org/indonesia/en/), as a tool for drought monitoring during El Niño.

**2017**

 - VAMPIRE won the [2017 WFP Innovation Challenge](https://insight.wfp.org/wfp-staff-show-entrepreneurial-side-in-annual-competition-be03924215).

 - Sri Lanka use VAMPIRE codebase to build [PRISM](http://52.221.143.5/prism/) for drought monitoring and installed in National Disaster Management Office (NDMO).

**2018**

 - Regional Innovation Meeting held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia to discuss on integration between PRISM and VAMPIRE

**2019**

 - VAMPIRE+PRISM integration started for accelerating risk and impact in the WFP Regional Bureau Bangkok (RBB) countries, and become Platform for Real-time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM).

**2020**

 - PRISM deployed in [Mongolia](https://prism-mongolia.org)

## Who uses PRISM?

The goal of PRISM is to empower governments with the wealth of data and information available on climate risk. The platform provides tools to understand where to direct resources to reach populations most in need of protection and assistance. PRISM brings together national disaster management authorities, national meteorological offices and key line ministries such as agriculture, health, and social welfare to collectively monitor risks, prioritize responses and inform programmes and policies.

The system is actively used by government partners in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Cambodia, while deployments to Mongolia and Afghanistan are forthcoming. Beyond government partners, WFP also shares information from PRISM with its humanitarian and development partners – providing key data and information to a wide audience. As the project continues, WFP also plans to provide information from the system to citizens; providing last mile climate services directly to the communities most impacted by climate change.

## What information does PRISM produce?

The primary outputs of PRISM are interactive maps and charts, along with tables and reports. The system can generate standard climate risk monitoring indicators as well as risk and impact analytical products, which are adapted for each hazard and the populations at risk to them.

The indicators on hazards – including droughts and floods – can be monitored over time through intuitive and interactive maps. Charts and related tables help to quantify the extent of a hazard by administrative area (such as provinces and districts). In addition, the system can automatically produce risk and impact indicators based on the known vulnerabilities and exposure to hazards at any point in time. All of this information can be exported from the system for further analysis and reporting.

PRISM integrates with mobile data collection platforms – including open source solutions such as ODK and Kobo Toolbox. This allows users to visualize data collected from impacted areas in real-time, alongside the hazard information automatically generated by the platform.

## How does PRISM mitigate climate risk?

PRISM fills information gaps for decision makers by presenting them with risk and impact analytics in near real-time. In Cambodia and Sri Lanka, for instance, the platform is monitored daily in the operations center of each country's national disaster management agency. During times of high risk (such as the monsoon season), WFP and disaster management officers use PRISM to provide regular updates to government stakeholders and humanitarian and development partners.

Currently, WFP is connecting PRISM to risk reduction activities so that climate analysis informs programming. This includes links to Forecast-Based Financing (FBF), Early Warning / Early Action (EWEA) and Shock Responsive Social Protection (SRSP). As a risk analytics platform and monitoring system, PRISM can measure climate risks and,using preset thresholds, automatically alert programme managers of a potential disaster. For EWEA, PRISM can act as a trigger to initiate early action programming by providing key data on areas and populations at risk. In the case of SRSP, the system can provide data on the number of beneficiaries that a social protection programme may need to reach, both as a mitigation strategy and as a response to a disaster.

Importantly, risk analytics focused on vulnerable populations empowers disaster management authorities with information that then feeds into broader government responses beyond their own. In addition, as a platform which combines hazard information with vulnerability to calculate risk and impact, PRISM is capable of producing impact-based forecasts: converting climate information into programming which focuses on the socioeconomic impact of a hazard.


## Where we go from here and what we still need

A key component for the future of the project is to establish strategic partnerships. This includes continuing to build partnerships with government, and with the scientific and research communities to further improve the reliability of the platform. New private sector partnerships are being explored to further improve the technology, to gain access to more dynamic data generated through mobile phones and high-resolution satellite imagery.

WFP also works alongside research partners to improve the risk and impact analysis used in the system. This ongoing research examines the historical impact of climate hazards on vulnerable populations over time. The outcome of this research will inform more rigorous analysis generated by PRISM.

Ongoing user research is critical to understanding how current decisions are made, and how future decisions can be informed by data on risk and impact. Through design workshops, interviews, and consultations, WFP will develop a deeper understanding of the user needs of the system. This will in turn lead to improved design of the system and the development of new features that will ultimately help governments better serve vulnerable communities, save lives and protect livelihoods.
